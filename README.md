# 🎮 GameStore Web App – Azure Deployment

This repository contains a cloned version of the `cua24s_gamestore` application provided by our teacher as part of the *Inlämningsuppgift G* for the MTA course at JENSEN Yrkeshögskola. The main task was to focus on deploying the app to **Azure App Service** and configuring related **cloud services**.

## 📖 Extended Description

This project was carried out as part of the *Inlämningsuppgift G-nivå* for the course **MTA** at **JENSEN Yrkeshögskola**. The purpose of the assignment was to gain hands-on experience with deploying a pre-built web application to the cloud using **Microsoft Azure**.

The web application itself, `cua24s_gamestore`, was provided by our teacher through a public GitHub repository. My responsibility was focused entirely on the **cloud-based aspects**, not the application development.

Key tasks performed in this project:

- ✅ **Cloned** the given project repository locally  
- ✅ Tested the application locally using **Visual Studio Code**  
- ✅ Created an **Azure App Service** to host the web application  
- ✅ Deployed the application via **VS Code Azure extension**  
- ✅ Enabled **Application Insights** for logging and basic monitoring  
- ✅ Verified performance data, live metrics, and request tracking  
- ✅ Configured **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** by assigning roles  
- ✅ Activated **SSL (HTTPS Only)** to secure the application  

All steps and configurations were carefully documented through screenshots and written explanations, as required by the assignment instructions.

The result is a fully functional and secure web application running on Azure, monitored through Application Insights and managed using Azure’s built-in access control system.
